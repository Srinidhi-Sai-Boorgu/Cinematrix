## Instructions for setup (Windows)
`Node v18.20.8`, `npm 10.8.2`, `MySQL Workbench` are required. Once you've verified the installation and usage of said versions, follow the next instructions
### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/Aman1406-gupta/Cinematrix
cd Cinematrix
npm install
```
### 2. Configure the database
- Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your local MySQL instance.
- Run the following SQL scripts from the `database_queries` directory in the specified order:
    - Finalized Dataset.sql — Sets up the database schema and initial data.
    - indices.sql — Adds indexes to optimize query performance.

### 3. Get Nodemail password
- To use Nodemailer with Gmail:
- Go to your Google Account → Security
- Enable 2-Step Verification
- Under "Signing in to Google", select App passwords
- Generate a new app password.
- Use the generated 16-character password as your `nodemail_pass`.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and add the following configuration:

```bash
sql_host='localhost'
sql_user='root'                # Your SQL username
sql_pass='pass'                # Your SQL password
sql_name='cinematrix_db'       # Database name
sql_port=3306                  # Database port
app_port_no=1200               # Application port number
app_ip="127.0.0.1"             # Application IP address
secret_key="aiqw179"           # Secret key (create a new one)
nodemail_pass="abcd efgh ijkl mnop"   # Nodemailer password
```

> **Note:** Replace the values above with your actual credentials and configuration.

### 5. Start the Server
After setting up the environment variables, launch the application using the following command:
```bash
node index.js
```
Once started, the server will be running at the specified port. For example:
```
http://localhost:<app_port_no>
```

Replace `<app_port_no>` with the actual port number you specified in the `.env` file.
